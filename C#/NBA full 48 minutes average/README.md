An NBA game runs 48 minutes (Four 12 minute quarters). Players do not typically play the full game, subbing in and out as necessary. Your job is to extrapolate a player's points per game if they played the full 48 minutes.

Write a function that takes two arguments, ppg (points per game) and mpg (minutes per game) and returns a straight extrapolation of ppg per 48 minutes rounded to the nearest tenth. Return 0 if 0.

Examples:

Kata.NbaExtrap(12, 20) => 28.8

Kata.NbaExtrap(10, 10) => 48

Kata.NbaExtrap(5, 17)  => 14.1

Kata.NbaExtrap(0, 0)   => 0

Notes:

All inputs will be either be an integer or float.
